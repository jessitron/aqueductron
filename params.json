{"name":"Aqueductron","tagline":"self-modifying dataflow in Ruby","body":"### Aqueductron\r\n\r\nAqueductron is about turning data into information, one piece at a time. \r\n\r\nEach piece in a duct can filter data, change it, expand it, or split it into multiple flows. At the end of each duct is a collector, which summarizes or accumulates the data at the end.\r\n\r\nThe ducts are functional and immutable, persistent in the functional sense.\r\n\r\nPush data through the pipe, and you get back one or many results that the collectors have gathered for you.\r\n\r\nAqueductron uses an iteratee style of data processing, so that the processing of each message returns a function of what to do with the next message. This allows the ducts to alter themselves in response to the data flowing through them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
